# cox_api_challenge
This was a challenge I did for Cox Auto a little while after I graduated. I revisited it in 2021 to implement a multi-threaded approach as I was learning more about API's. This approach reduces total run time from 30-35seconds to 8.5seconds. I'm happy with the time reduction by the code is still spaghetti. Going forward this will be a really good project to test my refactoring skills, so you will probably see refactoring commits. No new functionality will be added.
